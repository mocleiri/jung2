Implementations of a notion of graph equivalence for blockmodeling.
<P/>
This equivalence refers to the network measure forms of equivalence used for blockmodeling. 
In blockmodeling, groups of vertices are clustered together by similarity (as if "blocked" together on the
diagonal of a matrix). 
<p/>
This implementation currently provides:
<ul>
<li/><code>EquivalenceAlgorithm</code>: An interface for an algorithm that returns an <code>EquivalenceRelation</code>.
<li/><code>EquivalenceRelation</code>: A class that represents several mutually-exclusive partitions of a set. 
The object is constructed with a Set of Sets; the 
members of each set are all vertices from the graph.  Vertices that are not equivalent to any 
other vertex are returned in singleton Sets.
<li/><code>StructurallyEquivalent</code>: An algorithm that finds sets of vertices that are 
structurally equivalent. Two vertices <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> are structurally equivalent if the set of <i>i</i>'s
neighbors must be identical to the set of <i>j</i>'s neighbors, with the exception of <i>i</i> and
<i>j</i> themselves. (In those cases, a directed edge may join <i>i</i> to <i>j</i> only if another
directed edge runs the other way.)
</ul>
